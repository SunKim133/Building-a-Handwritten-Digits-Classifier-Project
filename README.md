In this project, we'll build models that can classify handwritten digits. Before the year 2000, institutions like the United States Post Office used handwriting recognition software to read addresses, zip codes, and more. One of their approaches, which consists of pre-processing handwritten images then feeding to a neural network model is detailed in [this paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.852.5499&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
