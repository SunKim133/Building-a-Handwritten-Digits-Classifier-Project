In this project, I built a handwritten digits classifier using `K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm`, `Neural Network` with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers. For verifying the accuracy, I used `K-Fold` cross validation.
I used a pre-loaded dataset in Scikit-learn library. The `load_digits()` function returns a copy of the [hand-written digits dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits) from UCI.
